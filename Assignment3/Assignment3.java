1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.

-- Using a computer to lower someone's bank account balance
without a proper transaction and authorization can harm that
person financially. This type of actions should not be allowed.

.....

and so on.

(Don't use the above example. You need to have your own examples. Also make
sure your file name must be Assignment3.java, cannot be Assignment3.java.txt,etc)



1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.

-- Using someone else's code and claiming it as your own. Code should not 
	be copied like this as it is plagarism. Sourcing the owner of the code is 
	the right thing to do if it is acceptable.  
	
	
1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.

--If you are offering help to people, do not deny people who may be from 
a particular age, race, gender, etc. Help everyone and don't discriminate.


2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.

--Do not work somewhere that you do not have the necessary experience for. Example, 
if the job requires knowledge of Java, but you only know Python, it is important to disclose 
this information.


3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.

--I should not code with selfish intentions. I should code for the sake of the public good as 
it is the central concern.


4.1 Uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the Code.

--If I see a friend/peer attempting to violate the principles of the Code, I should
take responsible action and either disuade them of doing to violation, or reporting to an authoritative figure.
